# AI-Driven Development Lifecycle Project

## 📌 Introduction
This project demonstrates the **AI-Driven Development Lifecycle (AIDLC)**, which focuses on building AI systems in a structured and systematic manner.  
Instead of treating AI as a single model, this project emphasizes the **complete lifecycle** from problem understanding to deployment and improvement.

## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to understand how real-world AI systems are:
- Planned
- Designed
- Developed
- Evaluated
- Deployed
- Continuously improved

This approach reflects industry-standard AI development practices.

## 🔄 Phases of AI-Driven Development Lifecycle
1. **Problem Definition** – Identifying the problem and defining AI goals  
2. **Data Understanding & Preparation** – Understanding data requirements and preprocessing  
3. **Model Selection** – Choosing suitable AI or ML models  
4. **Workflow Design** – Designing AI pipelines and integrations  
5. **Implementation** – Developing and integrating AI components  
6. **Testing & Evaluation** – Measuring performance and validating results  
7. **Deployment** – Preparing the AI solution for real-world usage  
8. **Monitoring & Improvement** – Continuous tracking and optimization  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- AI Workflow Pipelines  
- Cloud-Based AI Services  
- AI Lifecycle Management Concepts  

## 📚 Key Learnings
- Importance of lifecycle-based AI development  
- Difference between experimental AI and production-ready AI
